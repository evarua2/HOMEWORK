    <h1>Web development</h1>
    <hr>
    <div>
    <P>
        <B>Web development</B> is the work involved in developing a <a href="">website</a> for the 
        <a href="">Internet</a>  (<a href="">World Wide Web</a>)  
        an <a href="">intranet</a> (a private network).<sup>[1]</sup>Web development 
        can range from developing a simple single <a href="">static page</a> of <a href="">plain 
        text</a> to complex <a href="">web applications, electronic businesses,</a> and 
        <a href="">social network services.</a>A more comprehensive list 
        of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include 
        <a href="">Web engineering, Web design, Web content development,</a> client 
        liaison, <a href="">client-side/server-side scripting, Web server</a> and 
        <a href="">network security</a> configuration, and <a href="">e-commerce</a> development.
    </P>
    <p>
        Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to 
        the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing 
        <a href="">markup</a> and <a href="">coding. <sup>[2]</sup></a>
        Web development may use <a href="">content management systems</a> (CMS) to make 
        content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams 
        can consist of hundreds of people (<a href="">Web developers</a>) and follow 
        standard methods like <a href="">Agile methodologies</a> while developing Web 
        sites. <sup>[1] </sup>
        Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or 
        contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job 
        positions such as a <a href="">graphic designer</a> or <a href="">information systems </a>
        technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort 
        between departments rather than the domain of a designated 
        department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: 
        <a href="">front-end developer,</a> back-end developer, and full-stack developer. <sup>[3]</sup>
        Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals 
        that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal 
        with the servers. <sup>[4]</sup> Since the commercialization of the Web, 
        the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used 
        technologies ever.
